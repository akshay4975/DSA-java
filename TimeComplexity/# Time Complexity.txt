# Time Complexity 

This folder contains my learning and practice related to **Time Complexity** as part of my DSA journey using **Java**.

Time Complexity helps us analyze how efficient an algorithm is based on the input size.

---

## Topics Covered

- What is Time Complexity?
- Why Time Complexity is important
- Best, Average, and Worst Case
- Big-O Notation
- Common Time Complexities:
  - O(1) – Constant Time
  - O(n) – Linear Time
  - O(n²) – Quadratic Time
  - O(log n) – Logarithmic Time
- Time Complexity of loops
- Time Complexity of nested loops
- Basic analysis of array operations

---

## Key Learnings

- Time Complexity focuses on **growth of operations**, not actual execution time
- Nested loops significantly increase complexity
- Choosing the right algorithm matters more than hardware speed
- Optimization often means reducing unnecessary loops

---

##  Files Included

- `Notes.md` – Conceptual explanation and examples  
- Java programs demonstrating time complexity analysis (if added)

---

##  Goal

- Build a strong foundation for DSA
- Analyze code efficiency before implementation
- Prepare for coding interviews and competitive programming

---

##  Language Used

- Java

*This is the first step in my DSA journey. More optimized and advanced problems will be added as I progress.*
